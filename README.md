# Barracuda ü¶à

A simple header-only pseudo-stack-based equation solver capable of running on the GPU in 'effective' stacksize-linear time. Evaluates inversely stored reverse polish notation (RPN) instructions from input stacks.

## Inputs üì§

* **stack**: an input integer instruction stack corresponding to whether a value or an operation is executed. Operations can also consist of loading (storing) arbitrary variables to the output stack. The stack is evaluated ("pop"-ed) last-to-first 
* **stacksize**: size of the instruction stack.
* **opstack**: stack containing integer values of operation instructions corresponding to the enumerator types (OPCODES).
* **opstacksize**: size of the opstack. The opstack is evaluated ("pop"-ed) last-to-first.
* **valuestack**: stack containing floating point values to be loaded to the output stack.
* **valuestacksize**: size of the valuestack. The valuestack is evaluated ("pop"-ed) last-to-first.
* **outputstack**: stack storing the "outputs" of applied operations or stores for future use. Operations from the opstack apply directly to the outputstack.  I.e. to perform multiplication of two variables, first load these into the output stack and then apply the OPCODE (0x3CE) in the opstack.
* **tid**, **nt**: the thread index and number of threads. These are used so that the VM can determine appropriate memory indices and bounds.
* **userspace**: allows users to use memory in the form of arrays/objects/etc. Some form of userspace should always be allocated for environment variables (if used) regardless, the "user" part of the userspace is the extension of the userspace past the environment variables to the maximum size of the number and sizes of allocated arrays by the user in their program code.
* **userspace_sizes**: an array of two sizes ```[mutable_array_size, constant_array_size]```, these allow Barracuda to appropriately determine offsets between mutable userspace and constant userspace.

## Written Examples ‚ÑπÔ∏è

A = 2, B = 3, C = 4

expr = A \* B + C

expr(RPN): AB\*C+

```cpp
stack[5] = {0,1,0,1,1}
opstack[5] = {0x3CC,0,0x3CE,0,0};
valuestack[5] = {0,4,0,3,2};
```

The above code evaluates to:  
push(2)  --> A  
push(3)  --> B  
v = MUL(2,3) --> A\*B  
push(v) --> A\*B  
push(4) --> C  
v = ADD(6,4) --> A\*B + C  
push(v) --> A\*B + C  

when MUL, ADD or any operation are used, pop(outputstack) is called an appropriate number of times relative to the number of inputs the function requires.

## Provided Examples ‚ÑπÔ∏è

All previous examples have now been deprecated due to several significant changes and the development of an open-source compiler for Barracuda. Due to this change the primary example of Barracuda is now vm_generic, which compiles a generic form standalone of the Barracuda VM (with two example environment variables set for testing). This generic VM is provided to allow for testing of arbitrary compiled Barracuda code from the rust barracuda compiler. A testing framework for this has been made in Python to implement tests that run both the compiler and the VM for end-to-end testing and validation.

## Contributing üíØ

All contributions are more than welcome. This project has mostly been solo developed with small contributions here and there from members of the Barracuda compiler team. As of v1.0.0 this project uses [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (CC) for consistency and simplicity of project maintainance and contribution. All contributions are required to follow the CC specification, using the [Commitizen](https://pypi.org/project/commitizen/) tool is likely the simplest way to achieve this.

Recommendations for contributions:

* New features are less important than bug fixes, if creating a new feature please provide all necessary testing code alongside any PRs/issues.
* Bug fixes and defensive systems (e.g., bounds checking) are always welcome, but make sure you test any and all changes and submit testing code (where different from existing infrastructure) to the PR/issue. It is also a good idea to run performance benchmarks (e.g., Mandelbrot) to quantify any performance improvements/degradation.
* Refactors should only be performed if they contribute to performance gains or if they significantly increase the simplicity, readability, understanding or debugging of the VM.
